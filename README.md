# probability #

`probability` is a dice-rolling simulator to demonstrate to students the mathematical concepts of:
*   Observed probability
*   Actual probability
*   Law of Large Number
*   Law of Small Numbers

... as well as the computational concepts of:
*   Automation
*   Simulation
*   Basic algorithms

# dice-sim #

`dice-sim` is similar to `probability`, but written in React using `create-react-app`.  React was chosen to aid in state management, as this version will have functionality to step through our dice-rolling simulation algorithm.

# electoral-college #

`electoral-college` is a tool for learning about the strengths and weaknesses of the US's electoral college system.  TODO: more info here.
